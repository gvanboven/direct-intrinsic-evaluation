## Supplementary materials for direct intrinsic evaluation of word embeddings
  
This repository contains the stimuli, results and code of analysis of our study.

The folder `Model_results` includes the nearest neighbours of the models used.

In the folder `Test_results` the responses of the participants can be found. 

An example of each experiment is included. 

The scores in the `Results_OutDet_participantx.csv` can be interpreted as follows: 

	-1 = none option

	0 = wrong answer

	1 = correct answer

The scores in the 'ourlier_participant_res.csv'can be interpreted as follows:   

	1 = target term

	2 = nearest neighbour rank 1

	3 = nearest neighbour rank 2

	4 = outlier

	5 = the none option

In the files `Results_Syn_Det_partx_participantx.csv` a score of 1 means the model was selected, 0 means it was not.

The folder `Notebooks` includes the code for stimuli extraction and analysis.
